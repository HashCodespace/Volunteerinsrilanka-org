<section id="Overview">
Sri Lanka is one of those countries where Buddhism was spread in its earliest days. It's not just a prominent religion in the nation, but a way of life as well. Being a volunteer for the Teaching Monks Program, you'll be working at a Pirivena, an educational institution of Buddhist monks (a school, you may say).
<br>
<br>
In this institution, the monks get a holistic learning opportunity, studying different subjects like Pali (an Indo-Aryan language), Sanskrit, history, prosody, astrology, and logic, apart from the scriptures of Buddhism. The Pirivena is also the place where young monks are trained by their masters to follow the rules and regulations promulgated in the Vinaya Pitaka (a prominent Buddhist scripture) which is one of the three parts that make up the Tripitaka - a collection of Buddhist teachings that are the foundation of the Theravada Buddhist philosophy.
<br>
<br>

These young monks are highly enthusiastic to learn English, however, they do not have adequate resources to polish their skills. The Government has appointed local teachers who take a 40 minutes class every day, but even the teachers aren't well versed with the language. Hence, being a volunteer, you'll get to play an active role in the Pirivena and teach these bright monks.
