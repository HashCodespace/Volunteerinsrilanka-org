<h1 class="h2 section-title " >Protecting Sri Lanka's Sea Turtles</h1>

Sri Lanka, a country renowned for its rich biodiversity, is home to several species of sea turtles. Unfortunately, these majestic creatures are facing numerous threats, including habitat destruction, pollution, and poaching. The Sri Lanka Turtle Conservation Volunteer Program offers an extraordinary opportunity to contribute to the protection and rehabilitation of sea turtles while actively participating in community development projects. In this article, we will explore the background and significance of the Turtle Conservation Program, volunteer placement examples, and the roles and responsibilities of volunteers in safeguarding these remarkable marine creatures.

<h2 class="h3 section-title " >Background to the Turtle Conservation Program</h2>

Sri Lanka is blessed with an abundance of sea turtle species, including the Green Turtle, Hawksbill, Loggerhead, Olive Ridley, and Leatherback. However, several of these species are critically endangered and on the brink of extinction due to hunting, habitat loss, and human activities. The Turtle Conservation Program aims to address these challenges by focusing on various conservation efforts.

One significant aspect of the program involves the rehabilitation and care of disabled turtles. Many of these turtles are found by local fishermen who bring them to the project site, located near the fishing ports. These injured turtles require ongoing support and rehabilitation to regain their strength and ability to survive in the wild.

Additionally, the program emphasizes raising awareness about the environmental impact of plastic pollution. The excessive use of plastic has led to a global crisis, with millions of microplastics polluting the oceans and posing a severe threat to marine life. The Sri Lanka Turtle Conservation Volunteers actively work towards mitigating this problem and promoting environmental consciousness.


<h2 class="h3 section-title " >Turtle Conservation Volunteer Placement Examples</h2>

<div class="margin-l-1">
<h3 class="h4 section-title unset-align" >1. Turtle Conservation Sanctuary</h3>
As a volunteer, you will contribute to the daily care and rehabilitation of disabled turtles in Galle. Your volunteer work will be scheduled from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and you will have the opportunity to return to the volunteer accommodation after your volunteering hours.

The long-term goal is to release healthy turtles back into the wild and protect turtle eggs from poachers. Throughout your placement, you will learn essential skills such as nest care, turtle identification, egg hatching, turtle treatment, and releasing turtles back into the sea. This placement offers a valuable opportunity to make a tangible difference in the lives of these remarkable creatures.


<h3 class="h4 section-title unset-align" >2. Beach Cleans</h3>

Female turtles only lay their eggs on beaches that are safe and clean. To encourage nesting, volunteers actively participate in cleaning the local beaches, removing litter and dangerous debris. With the increasing threat of climate change and plastic pollution, beach cleans play a crucial role in creating a safe environment for nesting turtles. The goal is to collect approximately 200 kilograms of rubbish from the beaches each day, and volunteers are instrumental in achieving this target.

<h3 class="h4 section-title unset-align" >3. Turtle Hatchery and Baby Turtle Release</h3>

Volunteers play a vital role in nesting, monitoring, and caring for turtle eggs brought to the hatchery. These eggs are often relocated from unsafe areas where they are at risk from human activities and poachers. The hatchery provides a secure environment for the eggs to hatch, ensuring the conservation of the species. Volunteers adhere to the guidelines set by the National Wildlife Department and assist in the release of baby turtles back into the wild.
