<section id="Overview">

Welcome to Sambodhi, a special place where physical and intellectual disabled homeless people find a safe and caring environment. Sambodhi provides care for 55 individuals ranging from 7 to 75 years old, each with their own unique story. Some were abandoned by their families due to their disability, while others were left behind because their families lacked the resources to care for them.

With limited staff and resources, the residents of Sambodhi rely on each other to carry out daily tasks. The youngest children attend school in the morning, but for the rest of the residents, there is no structured routine beyond meal times and twice-daily tea breaks. This is where you come in as a volunteer - you can make a real difference in the residents' daily lives by contributing to their well-being.

As a volunteer, you will have the opportunity to help residents engage in creative activities and play games, providing them with a much-needed break from their daily routine. Physiotherapists are also welcome to practice with disabled individuals. Your presence and contributions will help to boost the residents' morale and create a sense of community.
