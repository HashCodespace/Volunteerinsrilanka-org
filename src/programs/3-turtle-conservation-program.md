<section id="Overview">

You can protect and rehabilitate sea turtles whilst also helping at community development projects as a Sri Lanka turtle conservation volunteer. Many species of turtles are under threat and at risk of becoming endangered, hence there is a great need for wildlife conservation efforts. Raise awareness of plastic pollution, care for injured and disable turtles and release freshly hatched babies back into the wild, safe from natural risks and local poachers.

<h2 class="h2 section-title " >Background To The Turtle Conservation Program</h2>

In Sri Lanka, there are five species of turtles that are commonly encountered. These are the Green Turtle, Hawksbill, Loggerhead, Olive Ridley and Leatherback. The Green turtle is the most common turtle species and will likely be the one you come across the most if you volunteer in Sri Lanka. The Loggerhead turtle is the rarest and thus hardest to spot in Sri Lanka. They are more commonly found on the East Coast of America.

 

The Hawksbill (renowned for its beautiful shell), Olive Ridley (smallest of the sea turtles) and Leatherback (largest of the 5 species) are harder to spot for different reasons. Sadly they are critically endangered and sit on the brink of extinction. This is mainly because they have been heavily hunted and fell victim to other human activity as well.


For instance, fishing is one of the major industries in south of Sri Lanka. The location of the volunteer work in Sri Lanka is close to the local fisheries ports. Sea turtles are often found in fishing nets and many have lost limbs, becoming disabled and are no longer able to survive in the wild. Many of these disabled turtles are found by local fishermen who bring them to the project site for rehabilitation and care.

 

Most importantly, each environmental choice we make every day as a human has an impact upon all marine life. Millions of microplastics, straws and bottles are found in the sea and beaches across the globe. Plastic pollution is becoming a huge problem worldwide and our Sri Lanka turtle conservation volunteers aim to fight the battle against this environmental catastrophe.

 

Volunteering with turtles in Sri Lanka on our turtle conservation program is an incredible opportunity to do your bit to care for these incredible creatures, whilst spending time in a country that will amaze you on so many levels.

<h2 class="h2 section-title " >Turtle Conservation Volunteer Placement Examples</h2>


 <b> Turtle Conservation Sanctuary </b> - Each Sri Lanka turtle conservation volunteer will be based at a turtle sanctuary in Galle. Here, the Sri Lanka volunteer program aims to provide daily care and rehabilitation for the disabled turtles. They have a long term goal to release the healthy turtles back to the wild, as well as protecting turtle eggs that have been stolen by local poachers.
 

Beginning from the orientation, volunteers will learn a great deal about turtle conservation. For instance, how to nest eggs, identify different kinds of turtles, how eggs hatch, how to treat turtles, the differences between the species, how to send turtles back into the sea and so much more. In short, this is a project where you will learn a lot and be able to make a tangible difference with your time.


Beach Cleans - As female turtles will only lay their eggs on beaches that are safe environments to them, it is crucial the area is maintained in order to encourage them to nest. Consequently, every Sri Lanka animal volunteer will get involved in cleaning the local beaches for litter and dangerous debris.

 

Climate change, waste and plastic pollution is increasing at an alarming rate across the world and we want to continue raising awareness and promote conservation through our volunteer program.


This is an important core task that volunteers will engage with in the Sri Lanka turtle conservation program. As part of the teams efforts to support coastal conservation, they aim to collect 200KG of rubbish from the beaches each day. Subsequently, volunteers are the driving force in achieving such goals.

<b>Turtle Hatchery & Baby Turtle Release </b>- Volunteers will help to nest, monitor and care for turtle eggs that have been brought to the turtle hatchery. Usually, these are removed from an unsafe area where they may be at risk from human activity. This often includes outside tourist hotels but also if they can be stolen by local poachers.

 

Across Asia, there is an ancient myth that eating turtle eggs and meat will increase your life span. As a result, turtle eggs are sold illegally on the black market. The hatchery provides a safe environment for the turtles to be nested and monitored for conservation. They follow the National Wildlife Department guidelines and release the babies back into the wild with the help each Sri Lanka turtle conservation volunteer.

<h2 class="h2 section-title " >Volunteer Roles & Responsibilities</h2>

	 Every turtle conservation volunteer will spend their time next to the beach caring for the sea turtles that have been rescued and are now living in the project site. Additionally, undertaking many beach cleans in the local area to keep beaches safe and clean for the turtles and their nests. Your volunteer program will run from Monday-Friday between 9am-12pm. You will get your project usually by scooter which takes about 10 minutes. Your typical duties as a volunteer in Sri Lanka will include:
   <br>
   <br>
	<ul class="section-text" style="margin-left: 2%;">
          <li>• Preparing fresh food and assisting feeding on a daily basis</li>
          <li>• Cleaning within the project premises and nearby beach area</li>
          <li>• Taking care of the nesting area</li>
          <li>• Regular beach cleans and beach patrols</li>
          <li>• Cleaning and refilling the turtle tanks</li>
          <li>• Assisting with medication</li>
          <li>• Cleaning the turtles’ shells</li>
          <li>• Counting and burying turtle eggs safely</li>
          <li>• Designing education boards around the sanctuary</li>
          <li>• Painting and drawing for information and animal welfare education</li>
          <li>• Releasing hatched baby turtles into the sea </li>               
        </ul>

Each Sri Lanka turtle conservation volunteer will join with the local staff at the project to get to grips with the daily tasks and what is expected of them. This will include tasks as part of a team as well as individual roles

 

You can do your bit to help tackle the global issue of plastic pollution by cleaning the beaches where many turtles lay eggs in the south. Although this may be one of the more mundane aspects of the program, its importance cannot be underestimated. The volunteer's efforts are recognised positively by the Wildlife Department. It is not uncommon that after one beach clean we have collected up to 20 bags of litter!
