Taking a gap year is about more than just travel — it’s a chance to discover yourself, step out of your comfort zone, and make an impact in the world. For many students, volunteering abroad during this time adds meaning to the adventure, blending cultural immersion with personal growth. If you’re planning your gap year and wondering where to begin, Sri Lanka is a destination that truly stands out.



## Why Choose Sri Lanka for Your Gap Year?

Sri Lanka is more than just golden beaches, lush tea plantations, and historic temples. It’s a country rich in culture, resilience, and hospitality. While Sri Lanka has made impressive strides in recovering from its post-pandemic financial crisis and past challenges such as the 2004 tsunami and civil conflict, there are still areas where volunteers can make a genuine difference.

When you volunteer here, you’ll go beyond the tourist trail. You’ll live within the community, understand local life, and contribute to meaningful projects that support education, healthcare, and wildlife conservation. Whether you’re teaching children, helping protect endangered turtles, or working with special needs individuals, you’ll see firsthand the impact of your time and energy.

The southern coast — where most of our programs are based — offers a blend of rural villages, vibrant coastal towns, and wildlife-rich landscapes. It’s a place where your gap year can transform into an unforgettable chapter of learning, giving back, and personal growth.

## About Us – Volunteer in Sri Lanka

At Volunteer in Sri Lanka, we specialise in connecting travellers like you with real, sustainable opportunities that leave a lasting mark. We’re a fully local organisation, born and operated in Sri Lanka, with over 20 years of experience in hospitality and volunteer management.

Our mission is twofold: to create meaningful change in local communities and to give volunteers the chance to have an authentic, safe, and life-changing experience. By joining one of our programs, you’ll become part of a global network of young changemakers contributing to a brighter future for Sri Lanka.



## Our Volunteer Programs

No matter what your interests are, there’s a program that matches your skills and passions:

### [Kindergarten Teaching Program](https://volunteerinsrilanka.org/volunteer-programs/kindergarten-teaching-volunteer-program-in-sri-lanka/)

### [Teaching English to Buddhist Monks](https://volunteerinsrilanka.org/volunteer-programs/teaching-english-to-buddhist-monks-in-sri-lanka-program/)

### [Turtle Conservation Program](https://volunteerinsrilanka.org/volunteer-programs/turtle-conservation-volunteer-program-in-sri-lanka-galle/)

Sri Lanka’s southern coast is home to endangered sea turtles. As a volunteer, you’ll protect nesting sites, care for hatchlings, feed injured turtles, and take part in beach clean-ups. It’s ideal for nature lovers and aspiring marine biologists.

## Do I Need Experience to Volunteer?

Not at all. Most of our programs don’t require qualifications or previous experience. Whether you’re fresh out of school or exploring your options during your gap year, we’ll provide full orientation and guidance. From lesson planning to handling turtle hatchlings, our team supports you every step of the way.

* A private, air-conditioned room
* Daily breakfast and dinner (vegetarian options available)
* Shared kitchen access
* Stable Wi-Fi

## Is Volunteering in Sri Lanka Safe?

Yes — Sri Lanka is widely considered a safe and welcoming country for international travellers. In fact, TimeOut.com recently ranked it the **\#1 destination for solo female travellers in 2024**.

While standard travel precautions apply, most visitors find Sri Lanka peaceful and friendly. At Volunteer in Sri Lanka, your safety is our priority. We personally inspect every project site, provide thorough orientation, and ensure you have access to 24/7 support from our coordinators.



## Living the Local Culture

Sri Lanka is known for its warm hospitality, but it’s important to be mindful of cultural norms. Dress modestly, remove shoes before entering temples or homes, and greet locals with a smile. During orientation, we’ll teach you basic Sinhala phrases, cultural guidelines, and program expectations to help you settle in.

## What Should I Pack?

The tropical climate means light, breathable clothing is best. Don’t forget:

* Clothes covering shoulders and knees (for temples and schools)
* Comfortable shoes or sandals
* Refillable water bottle
* High-SPF sunscreen and insect repellent
* Power adapter (Type G)
* Rain jacket (monsoon season)
