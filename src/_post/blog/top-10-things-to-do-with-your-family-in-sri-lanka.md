#### Go on Wildlife Safaris

Sri Lanka has a wide range of wildlife and a safari is a must-do family activity. Yala National Park, Wilpattu National Park, and Uda Walawe National Park are the best places to see leopards, elephants, deer, and many exotic birds. Families can enjoy guided jeep safaris where kids will love seeing animals in the wild. Seeing an elephant or a peacock amidst the greenery is an experience every family member will treasure.

#### Visit the Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage

Visit the Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage
in the center of the island for an educational and fun experience for the
family. The orphanage takes care of abandoned and injured elephants and
visitors can watch them bathe in the river, feed them, and even get up close
for some photos. It’s a heartwarming experience where kids can learn about
animal conservation and wildlife protection.
