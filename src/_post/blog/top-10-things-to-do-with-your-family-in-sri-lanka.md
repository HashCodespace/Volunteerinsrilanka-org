#### Go on Wildlife Safaris

Sri Lanka has a wide range of wildlife and a safari is a must-do family activity. Yala National Park, Wilpattu National Park, and Uda Walawe National Park are the best places to see leopards, elephants, deer, and many exotic birds. Families can enjoy guided jeep safaris where kids will love seeing animals in the wild. Seeing an elephant or a peacock amidst the greenery is an experience every family member will treasure.
