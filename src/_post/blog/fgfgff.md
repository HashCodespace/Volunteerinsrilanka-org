Email: taw@ucsc.cmb.ac.lk



Learning Outcomes

By the end of this topic, students should be able to:



Identify different types of business information systems (BIS) in an organization.

Categorize BIS from both a functional and constituency perspective.

Analyze the functionalities of different types of BIS.

Draw data flow diagrams (DFDs) to depict business processes.

Describe different types of management reports.

Types of Business Information Systems (BIS)

BIS can be categorized using two perspectives:



##### 1. Functional Perspective

This approach identifies systems based on their major business functions:



Sales and Marketing Systems

Manufacturing and Production Systems

Finance and Accounting Systems

Human Resource Systems

#### 2. Constituency Perspective

This approach identifies systems in terms of the organizational groups they serve:



Transaction Processing Systems (TPS)

Management Information Systems (MIS)

Decision Support Systems (DSS)

Executive Support Systems (ESS)

Functional Perspective Systems

### 1. Sales and Marketing Information Systems

Major Functions: Sales management, market research, promotion, pricing, identifying new products.

Strategic Level: Supports new products and services, monitors market trends.

Management Level: Supports advertising, promotions, pricing decisions, sales performance analysis.

> Knowledge Level: Analyzes market data.
>
> Operational Level: Tracks sales, processes orders, manages customer support.
