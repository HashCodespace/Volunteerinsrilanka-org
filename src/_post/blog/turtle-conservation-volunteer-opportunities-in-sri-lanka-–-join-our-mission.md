Sri Lanka is home to five of the seven sea turtle species found worldwide, but their survival is under constant threat. At Volunteer in Sri Lanka, we are dedicated to protecting these magnificent creatures through our Turtle Conservation Volunteer Program in Galle. Our initiative provides a hands-on opportunity for volunteers to actively contribute to the well-being of endangered sea turtles while experiencing the beauty and culture of Sri Lanka.

Whether you are an aspiring marine biologist, a family looking for an enriching experience, or a solo traveler eager to make a difference, our program offers a meaningful way to engage in conservation efforts.

 

## [Join Our Turtle Conservation Efforts in Galle](https://volunteerinsrilanka.org/volunteer-programs/turtle-conservation-volunteer-program-in-sri-lanka-galle/)

Our turtle conservation volunteer program is based in Koggala, Galle, where you will contribute to ongoing conservation efforts by caring for rescued turtles, protecting nesting sites, releasing hatchlings, and raising awareness within local communities. Each morning, you’ll work alongside our team from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM, participating in a variety of essential activities.

### Protecting Sea Turtle Nesting Sites

Pollution, climate change, and human interference threaten the natural nesting sites of sea turtles. As part of our conservation initiative, volunteers actively participate in beach clean-ups, removing plastic waste and debris that pose serious risks to both nesting turtles and hatchlings. Keeping the beaches clean not only provides a safe nesting environment but also contributes to the overall health of Sri Lanka’s coastal ecosystems.

In addition to hands-on work with the turtles, volunteers also help with community education programs, spreading awareness about conservation and inspiring local communities to take an active role in protecting marine life.

### Hands-on experience in Turtle Rehabilitation

Many of the turtles that come to our sanctuary suffer from injuries caused by fishing nets, boat strikes, or plastic ingestion. Volunteers assist our team in cleaning wounds, applying medication, and providing ongoing care to help these turtles recover. For those with severe injuries, such as amputations from entanglement, our facility becomes a permanent home where they receive lifelong care.

By working closely with our conservation team, volunteers gain firsthand experience in marine biology, wildlife rehabilitation, and sustainable conservation practices. This program is ideal for anyone interested in marine sciences or simply passionate about protecting sea life.

### Turtle Hatchery and Baby Turtle Release

One of the most rewarding aspects of the program is working at the Turtle Hatchery. Here, you’ll assist in relocating eggs from unsafe nesting areas to protected hatcheries. Once the eggs hatch, you’ll help monitor the baby turtles. Volunteers then help guide the baby turtles safely to the ocean, increasing their chances of survival in the wild.

This experience isn’t just about conservation—it’s about becoming part of something bigger. You’ll leave with new skills, unforgettable memories, and the knowledge that your efforts are helping to protect a species on the brink of extinction.

## [Explore Sri Lanka on Your Weekends](https://volunteerinsrilanka.org/experiance-sri-lanka/)

While your weekdays are dedicated to conservation, your weekends are completely free to explore Sri Lanka’s incredible landscapes, culture, and adventure opportunities.

Take a short tuk-tuk ride to Galle Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage Site filled with colonial history, vibrant street markets, and breathtaking ocean views. Relax on the golden beaches of Unawatuna and Mirissa, go whale watching, or dive into crystal-clear waters for an unforgettable snorkeling and scuba diving experience. If you love nature, venture into the Kanneliya Rainforest to witness stunning waterfalls and exotic wildlife. For the thrill-seekers, skydiving over Koggala or surfing in Weligama are experiences you don’t want to miss.



## How Our Programs at Volunteer in Sri Lanka Help Marine Conservation

Sea turtles are among the most ancient creatures on Earth, having existed for over 100 million years. However, today, all seven species of sea turtles are classified as endangered or critically endangered. In Sri Lanka, sea turtles face numerous threats, including habitat destruction, plastic pollution, illegal poaching, and climate change.

By joining our turtle conservation volunteer program, you become part of a global effort to protect these majestic creatures and contribute to the well-being of Sri Lanka’s marine ecosystem. Your efforts will not only benefit the turtles but also empower local communities to continue conservation work long after your volunteer experience ends.

At Volunteer in Sri Lanka, we believe in creating a sustainable and lasting impact. The program fees directly support turtle conservation efforts, including medical treatment, food for rescued turtles, hatchery maintenance, and environmental initiatives such as community education programs and beach restoration projects.
