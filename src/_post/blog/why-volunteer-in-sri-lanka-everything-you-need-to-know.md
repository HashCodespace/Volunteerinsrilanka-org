Volunteering in Sri Lanka lets you go beyond sightseeing and connect with the heart of the island — its people, culture, and nature. Sri Lanka has shown incredible resilience after challenges like the civil war, the 2004 tsunami, and the recent economic crisis. Yet, there are still areas where your support can make a real difference — from education and healthcare to wildlife conservation and community empowerment.

At Volunteer in Sri Lanka, we connect passionate travelers with meaningful projects that create lasting change while offering an unforgettable cultural experience.

Sri Lanka’s southern coast — where most of our programs are based — is a vibrant mix of rural villages, coastal communities, and wildlife reserves.

It’s not just travel. It’s a transformation — for you and the community.
