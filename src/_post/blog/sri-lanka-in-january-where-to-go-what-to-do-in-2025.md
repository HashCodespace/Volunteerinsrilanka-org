### Hike in Sri Lanka’s Hill Country

For the outdoor enthusiast, January is the best time to explore Sri Lanka’s hill country. Horton Plains National Park is home to World’s End, a cliff with an 880-meter drop and breathtaking views of the plains below. For a spiritual hike climb Adam’s Peak (Sri Pada), a sacred mountain that attracts pilgrims from all over Sri Lanka. The pre-dawn climb is special as you get to see the first light of the sun from the top which is a sacred site for Buddhists, Hindus, Christians, and Muslims.

### Experience Sri Lanka’s Tea Heritage in Nuwara Eliya

Sri Lanka is famous for its tea and Nuwara Eliya is the heart of the tea industry on the island. Known as “Little England” Nuwara Eliya is a must-visit to experience the tea heritage. Visit some of the most famous tea plantations such as Pedro Tea Estate for a guided tour to learn about the history and process of tea production. Don’t miss the chance to taste the finest Ceylon tea, famous for its unique flavor and quality. The hill country climate is a perfect escape from the tropical heat and the colonial charm of Nuwara Eliya adds to the appeal.

### Whale Watching in Mirissa

January is the best time to visit Mirissa and watch whales. On the early morning boat tours you can see the majestic blue whales, sperm whales, and playful dolphins swimming off the coast. The waters around Mirissa are rich in marine life so this is a must-do for nature lovers and wildlife enthusiasts. The boat tours are led by experienced guides who will share interesting facts about the whales and the marine ecosystem.

### Chill Out on Sri Lanka’s Southern Coast Beaches

Sri Lanka in January is perfect to relax on the southern beaches. The calm seas and good weather make Unawatuna, Tangalle, and Hikkaduwa perfect for swimming, snorkeling, and sunbathing. These beaches are less crowded than the more touristy areas and very peaceful. If you are a water sports enthusiast you can also try surfing, kite surfing, and diving.

### Visit the Historic Galle Fort

A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Galle Fort is a must-see for history and architecture lovers. This ancient colonial fort is a mix of cultures where Dutch, Portuguese, and British influences blend in.
