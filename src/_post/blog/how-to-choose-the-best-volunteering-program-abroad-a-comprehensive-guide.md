Volunteering abroad is a life-changing journey that allows you to make a meaningful impact while experiencing a new culture, gaining valuable skills, and broadening your perspective. With countless programs available worldwide, choosing the right one can feel overwhelming. To ensure your experience is rewarding, safe, and aligned with your goals, it’s essential to consider several key factors. Here’s how to select the best volunteering program abroad.

## Research the Organization

Before committing to a volunteer program, take the time to research the organization thoroughly. Check its legitimacy, transparency, and reviews from past volunteers. A reputable, well-established organization ensures your experience will be both safe and fulfilling.

At Volunteer in Sri Lanka, we bring over 20 years of hospitality experience, creating a supportive and secure environment for volunteers. As a fully local organization, owned and run by locals, we do not receive external funding. Volunteers fund their projects themselves, with program fees covering essential support services and acting as direct donations to the communities we serve. Every cent of your contribution goes directly to local initiatives, ensuring a lasting impact.

## Assess the Program’s Impact

A meaningful volunteer program creates real, long-term change and actively involves the local community. At Volunteer in Sri Lanka, we are committed to uplifting the communities we serve. Despite significant progress since challenges like the 2004 tsunami, the civil war, and the recent financial crisis, many areas still need support.

Our programs focus on critical areas such as education, health, and wildlife conservation, ensuring that your efforts make a tangible difference. We collaborate with local institutions that genuinely need assistance, allowing volunteers to experience daily life in Sri Lanka, understand the community's challenges, celebrate their resilience, and contribute to their well-being.

## Understand the Program Structure

A well-structured program is essential for a fulfilling volunteer experience. Consider the time commitment, roles, responsibilities, and the level of support provided by the organization. At Volunteer in Sri Lanka, our programs are designed to be both flexible and impactful.

Based in Rumassala, Galle, Sri Lanka, our programs run year-round. Volunteers typically work from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM, Monday to Friday, leaving plenty of time to explore and immerse yourself in the local culture. We provide a comprehensive orientation covering Sri Lankan customs, language, and program details, ensuring you feel prepared and confident. Plus, with 24/7 support from our local coordinators, you’ll always have someone to turn to for assistance.

Understanding the program fees and what they cover is crucial when choosing a volunteer program. At Volunteer in Sri Lanka, our program fee is USD 180 per week, which includes:

**Accommodation:** A private single A/C room at our volunteer house in Rumassala, Galle, just a 5-minute tuk-tuk ride from Galle City.

**Meals:** Breakfast and dinner featuring authentic Sri Lankan cuisine, with access to a stocked kitchen for self-catering.

**Airport pick-up:** Available for volunteers staying more than 4 weeks.

**Orientation:** A comprehensive introduction to Sri Lankan culture and your program.

**Wi-Fi:** Free internet access throughout your stay.

The fee does not cover flights, visa costs, or travel and medical insurance, so be sure to budget for these separately. Fortunately, Sri Lanka’s affordability makes it an ideal destination for budget-conscious travelers, with delicious street food and inexpensive transportation options.

## Evaluate Location and Safety

The location of your volunteer program plays a significant role in your overall experience. Galle, where our programs are based, is a charming city known for its rich history, stunning beaches, and welcoming locals. The iconic Galle Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is just a short distance from our volunteer accommodation, offering a glimpse into Sri Lanka’s colonial past.

Safety is a top priority at Volunteer in Sri Lanka. Galle is considered one of the safest cities in the country, and our team is always available to provide guidance and support. We ensure volunteers are well-informed about cultural norms and local customs, helping you navigate your new environment with confidence.

## Match Your Skills with the Program’s Needs

When choosing a volunteer program, it’s important to consider how your skills and interests align with the program’s needs. At Volunteer in Sri Lanka, we welcome individuals from all walks of life—whether you’re a professional, a student, on a gap year, or simply someone who wants to make a difference. No special qualifications are required for most of our programs, and we provide all necessary training and support to prepare you for your role.

For instance, our Turtle Conservation Program is an excellent opportunity for aspiring marine biologists to gain hands-on experience, while our teaching programs allow you to share your knowledge and passion with others.
