Once you’ve completed your volunteering placement — or even before you begin — you’ll want to experience the incredible destinations Sri Lanka has to offer. From bustling cities to ancient ruins, misty mountains, and golden beaches, here are some of the best places to explore.

Just minutes from our volunteer base, Galle is the perfect first stop. Its crown jewel is the **UNESCO-listed Galle Fort**, a 16th-century colonial fortress with cobblestone streets, Dutch villas, boutique cafés, and art galleries. You can watch the sun sink into the Indian Ocean from the ramparts or wander into **Unawatuna Beach** and **Jungle Beach** for snorkeling and relaxation.

### Colombo – Bustling Gateway to the Island

As the capital and main entry point, Colombo is a lively blend of tradition and modernity. Explore the **Pettah Market**, sample local street food, or enjoy a seaside stroll along **Galle Face Green**. The city also offers cultural landmarks like the **Gangaramaya Temple**, while its restaurants and shopping centers reflect the island’s cosmopolitan side.

### Kandy – The Sacred City in the Hills

A cultural treasure, Kandy is home to the **Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic**, one of Buddhism’s most significant shrines. The city sits on a serene lake, surrounded by lush highlands and botanical gardens. The annual **Esala Perahera festival**, with its colorful processions of dancers, drummers, and elephants, is one of the grandest in Asia.

### Sigiriya – The Iconic Lion Rock Fortress

Rising nearly 200 meters above the plains, **Sigiriya Rock Fortress** is often called the “Eighth Wonder of the World.” The climb to the top reveals frescoes, landscaped gardens, and sweeping views. Nearby, the **Dambulla Cave Temple** houses centuries-old Buddhist murals and over 150 statues. Together, these sites are a glimpse into Sri Lanka’s rich ancient past.

### Jaffna – Northern Culture and Resilience

A journey to Jaffna opens doors to Sri Lanka’s Tamil heritage. Here you’ll find colorful Hindu temples, delicious northern cuisine, and the historic **Jaffna Fort**. The slower pace of life offers a unique perspective and a chance to witness resilience and cultural richness after years of civil conflict.

### Nuwara Eliya – A Touch of England in the Tropics

Known as “Little England,” Nuwara Eliya is a highland town surrounded by tea plantations. Cool weather, colonial-era architecture, and attractions like **Gregory Lake** and **Hakgala Botanical Gardens** make it a refreshing retreat. Don’t miss touring a working **tea factory** to see how Sri Lanka’s world-famous Ceylon tea is produced.

### Ella – Sri Lanka’s Scenic Gem

The journey to Ella by train is one of the most beautiful in the world, winding through emerald tea fields and misty hills. Once there, you can hike **Little Adam’s Peak** or **Ella Rock**, and marvel at the **Nine Arches Bridge** as trains chug across. With its mix of adventure, natural beauty, and a laid-back backpacker vibe, Ella is a highlight for many travelers.
