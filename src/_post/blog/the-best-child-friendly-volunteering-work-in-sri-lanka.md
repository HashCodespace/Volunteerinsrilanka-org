If you are planning a family trip to Sri Lanka and want your children to experience something deeper than sightseeing, child-friendly volunteering is one of the most fulfilling choices you can make. Volunteering allows your family to step beyond the tourist route and become part of real community life. It gives your children the chance to learn, connect, and contribute in ways that will stay with them long after your holiday ends.

At Volunteer in Sri Lanka, we welcome families who want to make their travels meaningful. Our programs in Galle and Unawatuna are designed to be safe, supportive, and enriching for volunteers of all ages, including children.

 

## Why Volunteer with Your Children

Volunteering as a family transforms a holiday into a shared learning experience. It brings you closer as a family and introduces your children to a world of empathy and cultural understanding.

### Encourages Empathy

Your children will meet local kids, see how they live, and learn how kindness and compassion can make a difference in someone else’s day. Even small acts of help become powerful lessons.

### Builds Confidence

Participating in activities like storytelling, arts and crafts, and simple English games helps your children develop communication skills and social confidence.

### Strengthens Family Bonds

When you volunteer together, you work as a team, creating shared memories that are far more meaningful than a typical vacation.

### Offers Cultural Understanding

You and your children gain an authentic insight into Sri Lankan life. Instead of observing the culture from a distance, you are invited into it.

 

## Family-Friendly Volunteer Programs in Sri Lanka

At Volunteer in Sri Lanka, many of our programs are suitable for families. Your children can participate gently and safely, while you contribute in a structured and supportive environment.

### [Kindergarten Teaching Program](https://volunteerinsrilanka.org/volunteer-programs/kindergarten-teaching-volunteer-program-in-sri-lanka/)

### [Volunteer English Teaching Program](https://volunteerinsrilanka.org/volunteer-programs/volunteer-english-teaching-program-in-sri-lanka/)

If you have older children, they can join you in teaching basic English through songs, games, and interactive activities. You guide the lessons while your children take part naturally, making it a rewarding experience for local students.

### [Special Needs Care Program](https://volunteerinsrilanka.org/volunteer-programs/special-needs-care-volunteer-program-in-sri-lanka/)

This program allows your family to bring joy through play, music, arts and crafts, and companionship. It is a gentle environment where families can support children and adults with disabilities in meaningful ways.

### [Turtle Conservation Program](https://volunteerinsrilanka.org/volunteer-programs/turtle-conservation-volunteer-program-in-sri-lanka-galle/)

Families who love wildlife will enjoy this hands-on conservation experience. You help with feeding turtles, cleaning the tanks, supporting beach clean-ups, and learning about endangered species. Watching baby turtles is often the highlight for young volunteers.

## Family-Friendly Attractions in Galle and Unawatuna

Outside of your volunteering hours, you will find plenty of safe and enjoyable activities for children in the Galle and Unawatuna area.

### Galle Fort

A UNESCO World Heritage Site where children can walk freely, explore the lighthouse, watch the sunset, and enjoy ice cream along the ramparts.

### Unawatuna Beach

Perfect for families. The calm water, gentle waves, and shallow swimming areas make it one of the safest beaches for children in Sri Lanka.

### Turtle Hatcheries

These provide a closer look at marine conservation. Children love learning about sea turtles and seeing hatchlings up close.
