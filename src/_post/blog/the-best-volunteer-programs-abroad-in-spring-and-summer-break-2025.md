Looking for a meaningful way to spend your spring or summer break in 2025? Why not turn your time off into an unforgettable adventure that makes a real difference? Volunteering abroad in Sri Lanka offers a life-changing experience that combines cultural immersion, community impact, and breathtaking travel.

At Volunteer in Sri Lanka, our ethically-driven programs give you the chance to contribute to vital causes while exploring one of Asia’s most fascinating and beautiful countries. Whether you're a student, professional, or retiree, our volunteer opportunities are open to all with a heart to help and a spirit for adventure.



## Why Choose Sri Lanka for Volunteering?

![](/assets/img/spring-volunteer-8.jpg)

Sri Lanka is more than just a tropical paradise with golden beaches and tea-covered hills. It's a place of resilience, cultural richness, and warm hospitality. Though the country has made remarkable progress since the end of its civil war and the 2004 tsunami, many communities still face challenges in education, health care, and conservation.

Volunteering here offers you the chance to go beyond tourism and directly support local people and ecosystems. You’ll be immersed in a culture of humility and generosity, gain hands-on experience, and create lifelong memories — all while contributing to sustainable change.



## Why Volunteer with Us?

Volunteer in Sri Lanka is 100% locally owned and operated. With over 20 years of experience in hospitality and volunteer program management, we are passionate about ethical, impactful volunteering.

We believe in transparency, safety, cultural respect, and above all, real change. Every dollar from your program fee supports our community-based initiatives. There are no hidden costs or application fees. Just one goal: meaningful transformation for you and the people of Sri Lanka.

## What to Expect on Spring & Summer Volunteer Programs Abroad?

All of our programs operate year-round and typically run from Monday to Friday, with volunteers working from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM. Afternoons are free for you to explore the local area, learn more about Sri Lankan culture, or simply relax.

Every volunteer begins their journey with a detailed orientation session, which includes an introduction to local customs, basic Sinhala phrases, and a full overview of the chosen program. Throughout your stay, our local coordinators provide 24/7 support, ensuring that you always feel safe, guided, and valued.



## How Much Does It Cost to Join a Spring & Summer Volunteer Program Abroad?

Our program fees are designed to be both affordable and transparent. Starting at just $180 for one week, our packages include private air-conditioned accommodation, two delicious Sri Lankan meals per day (breakfast and dinner), Wi-Fi access, and orientation upon arrival.

For stays of four weeks or longer, we also offer free airport pickup and drop-off. Your contribution helps sustain our programs and directly supports the local communities we serve.



## Your Home Away from Home: Where You'll Stay

Our volunteer house in Rumassala, just minutes from Galle Fort, is safe, scenic, and serene. You’ll stay in private, air-conditioned rooms with access to a shared kitchen and Wi-Fi. Meals are freshly prepared with local ingredients, and we cater to vegetarian and special dietary needs.

We are constantly upgrading our facilities to ensure your comfort. Safety is our top priority. All accommodations and projects are thoroughly vetted, and Sri Lanka is considered one of Asia’s safest travel destinations.

## What to Do in Your Free Time

While your volunteer work will be deeply fulfilling, we also encourage you to explore the wonders of Sri Lanka during your free time. Visit the historic Galle Fort, relax on the golden sands of Unawatuna Beach, or take a boat ride on Koggala Lake. Enjoy the panoramic views from Rumassala Hill, visit the Japanese Peace Pagoda, and see sea turtles up close at the Habaraduwa Turtle Hatchery.

For longer excursions, you might consider going on a safari in Yala National Park, hiking through the misty landscapes of Horton Plains, touring the lush tea plantations in Ella, or surfing the waves at Arugam Bay. Volunteering with us allows you to experience the full diversity of Sri Lanka while making a real impact.
