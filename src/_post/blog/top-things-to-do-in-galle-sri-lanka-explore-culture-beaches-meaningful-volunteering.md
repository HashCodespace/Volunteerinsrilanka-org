Galle is one of Sri Lanka’s most enchanting coastal destinations, a place where colonial charm meets palm-fringed beaches, vibrant markets, forested hills, and warm, welcoming communities. Whether you’re visiting for history, nature, photography, or cultural immersion, Galle offers an unforgettable blend of experiences.

At Volunteer in Sri Lanka, we’ve welcomed travelers from around the world, and we’ve seen firsthand how deeply people connect with this beautiful city. If you’re planning a trip to Sri Lanka, here are the top things to do in Galle, including one opportunity many travelers find especially meaningful: volunteering with our local community projects.

 

## Walk Through Living History at Galle Fort

A must-see for every traveler, Galle Fort is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the best-preserved colonial forts in Asia. When you step inside its towering stone ramparts, you’re walking through centuries of Portuguese, Dutch, and British influence that still shape the daily life of the Fort’s residents.

Begin your stroll at the iconic Galle Lighthouse, shining bright above the Indian Ocean. As you follow the ramparts toward Flag Rock Bastion, you’ll pass families enjoying the sea breeze, artists sketching the coastline, and vendors selling fresh tropical fruits. Inside the Fort, narrow cobblestone streets guide you to boutique shops, charming cafés, museums, and beautifully restored colonial homes.

Don’t miss the Dutch Reformed Church, one of the city’s oldest buildings, where centuries-old gravestones and antique wooden pews echo stories from the past. Exploring the Fort is the perfect way to experience Galle, slow-paced, cultural, scenic, and full of life.

## Unwind at Unawatuna Beach

Just a short drive from Galle Fort, Unawatuna Beach remains one of Sri Lanka’s most popular seaside escapes. With its calm blue waters and soft golden sand, it’s perfect for swimming, sunbathing, snorkeling, or simply relaxing with a fresh king coconut in hand.

In the mornings, the water is crystal clear, ideal for spotting sea turtles along the reef. As the day goes on, the beach transitions into a lively social hub with cafés, seafood restaurants, and beach bars offering a spectacular sunset backdrop. Unawatuna is also where our accommodation at Volunteer in Sri Lanka is located. 



## Escape to Jungle Beach & Rumassala Hill

If you’re craving somewhere quieter, follow the lush trail to Jungle Beach, a hidden bay surrounded by greenery. It offers calm, shallow waters ideal for snorkeling and a peaceful break from busy beaches.

Overlooking the area is Rumassala Hill, a forested sanctuary wrapped in mythology. Locals believe this hill was brought here by Hanuman during the Ramayana era. Regardless of legend, the views from the Japanese Peace Pagoda at the top are breathtaking.

It’s a peaceful, scenic neighborhood just five minutes from Galle Fort, safe, welcoming, and perfectly positioned for travelers who want both comfort and cultural immersion.

## Visit the National Maritime Museum

Located inside the Fort, the National Maritime Museum is a fascinating stop for those curious about shipwrecks, old navigation instruments, coral ecosystems, and artifacts recovered after the 2004 tsunami. It’s a small museum, but it offers meaningful insight into the region’s maritime heritage and the resilience of coastal communities.

 

## Experience Local Life at Galle Markets

To understand Galle beyond the tourist spots, spend a morning exploring the city’s vibrant markets. The main fruit and vegetable market buzzes with color and activity, piles of pineapples, red bananas, spices, herbs, and friendly vendors calling out their prices.

If you visit the harbor at sunrise, the fish market is in full swing. Fishermen unload their early-morning catch of tuna, prawns, mullet, and squid while locals bargain energetically. It’s a raw, authentic slice of daily life that many travelers find unforgettable.

 

## Learn About Sea Turtles Along the Southern Coast

Galle’s coastline is home to several sea turtle nesting sites, and responsible hatcheries work tirelessly to protect the eggs and rehabilitate injured turtles. A visit to one of these centers gives you insight into the threats faced by these endangered species and the conservation efforts underway.

For travelers who feel inspired to get involved more deeply, our Turtle Conservation Program at Volunteer in Sri Lanka offers a hands-on chance to support this important work. Volunteers monitor nesting sites, protect eggs, care for injured turtles, maintain hatcheries, and release hatchlings safely back into the ocean.

It’s one of the most rewarding ways visitors can contribute to wildlife conservation during their stay.

## Take a Boat Safari on the Madu River

About 45 minutes from Galle, the Madu River stretches across a network of mangrove forests, islands, and waterways rich in biodiversity. A boat safari takes you past cinnamon plantations, fishing villages, tiny island temples, and peaceful mangrove tunnels where birds and monkeys thrive.

This relaxing journey is a favorite among travelers seeking nature, photography opportunities, and a peaceful escape.

## Explore Ancient Temples Around Galle

Galle is home to some remarkable Buddhist temples that reflect centuries of spiritual tradition. One of the most impressive is Yatagala Raja Maha Viharaya, nestled among giant boulders. Wander through quiet meditation spaces, ancient frescoes, and rock chambers that date back over 2,000 years.

Inside Galle Fort, the Sri Sudharmalaya Temple blends colonial architecture with Buddhist principles. These temples offer a peaceful break and a deeper look into Sri Lanka’s cultural identity.
