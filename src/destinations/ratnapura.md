Rathnapura's abundant gem-bearing deposits make it a must-see location on your Sri Lanka vacation itinerary. The Sinhala name is descriptive, literally meaning "Gem City." The flood plains and surrounding mountain ranges have provided an endless supply of white, yellow, pink, orange, purple, and blue star sapphires. This repository houses the legendary Blue Belle, which adorns the British Crown, as well as the star sapphire aptly named Star of India, which is on display at the Museum of Natural History in New York.The location was also known to wise King Solomon, who sent scouts to Sri Lanka to find sapphires for Queen Sheba. Seventeen of the world's largest blue sapphires were discovered in Sri Lanka's Gem City. The Star of India, Blue Giant of the Orient, Queen Mary of Romania, Logan Saphire, Blue Belle of Asia, Catherine the Great's Sapphire, and three J.P.Morgan sapphires are among them. They can be found in museums and collections ranging from the Smithsonian to the Moscow State Diamond Fund. Rubies, garnets, zircons, spinel, alexandrite, and citrine are also mined in Sri Lanka.
