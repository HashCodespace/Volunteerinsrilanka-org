The Buddhist narrative of Sri Lanka began in Mihintale, 13 kilometers east of Anuradhapura. Over 2000 years ago, the Indian Emperor Asoka dispatched his emissary Mahinda to Lanka with the Buddha's message. Devanampiyatissa, King of Sri Lanka, met Mahinda at Mihintale (Mahinda's Mountain), heard his story, and converted to Buddhism. The rest, as they say, is history, and it is that history that draws pilgrims to Mihintale. Mihintale, an ancient monastic city, commemorates the introduction of Buddhism to Sri Lanka in May with the Poson Full-moon festival. Climbing the rock and visiting the surrounding archeological sites are the best ways to experience Mihintale.

The ruins of an ancient hospital are at the foot of the mountain, while the 2nd century BC Kantaka Ceitya, the Mandapaya (pavillion), the Lion Bath, the Ambasthala Dagoba, the Aradhana Gala, and the 1st century BC Maha Seya dagoba are at the summit.
