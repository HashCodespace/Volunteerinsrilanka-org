Anuradhapura is one of the island's most famous ancient cities, and it is a must-see on every Sri Lanka vacation. Anuradhapura's pre-Christian remains place it in the pantheon of human history with Athens, Alexandria, and Patalipurhra. It illustrates the history of the Sinhalese civilisation beginning in the fourth century BC. The ancient record, the Mahavamsa, confirms that the city was built about 380 BC. The capital city of Sri Lanka's Sinhala Kings struggled, survived, was destroyed, and rebuilt like most other towns whose wealth and the jealousy of monarchs in its vicinity was a prescription for repeating calamities and ingenious engineering in restoration.
A magnificent collection of old ruins, some of which have been lovingly restored, narrates the previous grandeur. Sri Lanka history reaches out to you with the distant past of a stately capital and a monastic city of benign kings, dictatorial monarchs, retreating rulers, and heroic conquerors. The Dagoba - Thuparamaya was erected in the third century BC by King Devanam Piya Tissa to house the Buddha's clavicle, a precious relic sent to the Monarch by the Mauryan Missionary Emperor Asoka. In the ninth century, Pandyan monarchs invaded and devastated the city. The city's status as the capital of Sri Lanka came to an end in AD 993 when it was destroyed by an invading Indian Monarch.
Close to Anuradhapura is Mihintale, the oldest and the first wildlife sanctuary of all mankind. The story goes that King Devanam Piyatissa who was a deer hunt when he found Arahant Mahinda and by royal edict declared the entire area as a protected reserve a tradition that continues to this day. Other than Mihintale, there are more than 14 protected wild life parks you can visit on your Sri Lanka trip.

This shrine city is home to the world's oldest tree. Around the third century BC, it was transported from India. Its holiness stems from the fact that it was grown from the Bo Tree (ficus religiousa) in Bodhgaya, India. The Ascetic Siddharathe sought enlightenment under the shade of the parent tree. Anuradhapura's topography has thus been defined by the Buddha's relics housed in Stupas or Dagobas. Your vacation in Sri Lanka should be an enriching experience. Discover the answer to the question, "Can man escape his fate?" Yes. Visit the Buddha's Samadhi Statue, which is unparalleled in its deep peacefulness.
Can a royal bath be made as ornate in its scale and beauty as that of a cathedral? Yes, See the twin ponds. To learn about Sri Lanka is to learn about the genius of man.
