Before tea was introduced to the island Pearl fishing was the mainstay of the islands economy. Georges Bizet’s opera The Pearl Fishers, first performed in Paris in 1863 is set in Ceylon. In 1863 Sri Lanka then referred to as Ceylon was famous for Pearls. Tea came later. Before Tea the British tried Coffee. The entrepreneur James Taylor imported the first tea plants from Cathay in 1863. It was in 1863 that the Opera “the Pearl Fishers” by Georges Bizet set in Sri Lanka was first performed in Paris. An “opera seria” was being enacted in the hill country of the British colony. The central hills were then being cleared for tea plantations.Despite the rapacious advance of colonial commercial exploitation, the largest and the least disturbed remaining areas of the montane rain forests of Sri Lanka are a treasure trove of nature. It is regarded as a global super hot spot for conservation.

The carpets of thick emerald green tea bushes that cover the mountain slopes are the reason for the paved roads that wind up to Nuwaraeliya, the convenient base for your hill country exploration. "- One fact I wish to impress upon all-that the coloring of every description is diminished and not exaggerated, the real scene being in all cases a picture, of which the narration is but a feeble copy," writes Nile explorer Samuel Baker, who trekked through these pristine forests long before these paved roads. The exquisite perfection of nature that blended high peaks reaching to the clouds with Verdant Mountain slopes, cascading water falls and glittering streams was an irresistible lure to the British.
