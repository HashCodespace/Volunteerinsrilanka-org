Jaffna is one of the oldest human settlements in Northern Sri Lanka's peninsular region. The city served as the epicenter of a decade-long conflict that has now come to an end. In his blog, an elderly resident writes, "the quiet nostalgia for a gratifying past puts a faint smile on the granite brought in for reconstruction." An acclaimed artist captures the city's reconstruction and its residents' return to the once vibrant economy on canvas. "Continual transformation is the process that cities must endure when they emerge into new life," he says.When you visit the Jaffna peninsula and the colorful offshore islands that surround it on your Sri Lanka vacation, that canvas unfolds before your eyes. It was once the second largest city in Sri Lanka and an important Portuguese colonial hold. The Dutch Fort, which still dominates the Jaffna skyline, spans 22 hectares within the city limits. The Dutch built the star-shaped Jaffna Fort in 1680, and it is considered the best example of Dutch fortifications in Asia.

The Delft Fort was built by the Portuguese on Delft Island (Neduntivu islet) 35 kilometers from the city. A beautiful beach with exquisite shells is located behind the Fort. A ferry service connects the mainland and the largest island in the Palk Straits. The Kandaswamy Kovil, located in the city's Nallur quarter, was built in the South Indian Dravidian style. The shrine that once stood on the site before being destroyed by the Portuguese dates from the 10th century. Kantarodai has about 100 miniature dagobas or stupas crammed into a one-hectare area. The largest stupa has a diameter of about 4 meters. These are believed to be 2000 years old.Nagadeepa is a small island an hourâ€™s journey by boat from the city. The Buddhist temple recently restored is a temple revered by Buddhists of Sri Lanka who believe that it was visited by the Buddha.
