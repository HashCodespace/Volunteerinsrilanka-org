Negombo is a city that encompasses all of Sri Lanka's attractions. The essence of the ultimate Sri Lanka holiday experience is reflected in the Negombo lagoon, the sea, the scenic beaches, and a large polyglot community. Ornate Buddhist temples, Hindu shrines, Christian churches, and Muslim mosques attest to the spiritual harmony of a cosmopolitan community that has witnessed it all since the age of exploration, trade, and conquest. When the Sri Lanka flight lands in the International Airport, which is only 40 minutes away, the Dutch Canal and Fort stand ready to testify to its claim of being the first Sri Lankan destination you should visit.The facilities for swimming, snorkelling, diving, wind surfing, deep sea fishing and scuba diving tell you why holidays in Sri Lanka are a compact package that gives you both multiple pleasures and value.Negombo had its early beginnings as a trading port for Arab traders who came to Serendib (Sri Lanka) in search of cinnamon. The trading post survived the three European conquests, adjusting itself to the vicissitudes of both political control and trading opportunities. In the process Negombo evolved in to a smelting pot of diverse cultures, languages, religions and communities.

Sinhala, Tamil, and English are all widely spoken. The visitor facilities range from upmarket exclusive Sri Lanka Boutique hotels and five star resorts to budget accommodation sought by young people looking for the most for the least in cheap Sri Lanka holidays. If you enjoy seafood, you have almost reached the end of the road. The delicacies are provided by the ocean and the lagoon, and the Negombo fish market probably has no equal in this part of the world in terms of both selection and the ingenuity of its fishmongers. The people of Negombo come from various castes and communities and are completely accustomed to the cultural crossroads they find themselves in.
