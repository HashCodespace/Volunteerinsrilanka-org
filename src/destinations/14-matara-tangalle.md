Matara is located south of Galle, at the mouth of the Nilwala River. Its name refers to its location, the Great Fork. It was an important commercial center under both Portuguese and Dutch occupation. Matara is a bustling town sandwiched between sandy beaches and pastoral countryside, with fragrant spice plantations and green paddy fields. It has a well-preserved Dutch fort facing the Indian Ocean that was built in 1640 by the Dutch. It is a Portuguese garrison fortification. Many structures from the Dutch and British periods can be found at the fort. The Dutch church is the oldest of the colonial past that still draws attention.The 40-meter-high lighthouse, built in 1890 to guide ships plying the busy sea lane before radar, is 6 kilometers away. Nearby is a historic shrine dedicated to the Hindu deity Vishnu, whom Buddhists revere as the God entrusted with the mission of defending Buddhism in Sri Lanka.

Polhena which is 3kms away offers unspoilt beaches. The coral reef provides good snorkeling and swimming. The winds and the waves that offer good surfing prospects makes it a Sri Lanka Tourist attraction. A further 48 kms to the south is Tangalle, with one of the largest natural bays in the island, protected by a reef. You will find some superb beaches hidden in small coves and bays. These are not beaches that stretch for miles as in other Sri Lanka beaches. The quiet little beach fronts are ideal hideaways amongst the breeze that sweeps across the Tangalle bay.
