The third largest natural reserve in Sri Lanka, the Peak Wilderness Sanctuary is a tropical rainforest which derives its name from the surrounding areas of Adams Peak, Horton Plains, Pidhurutalagala and Hakgala. In 2009 the worldâ€™s rarest toad, the Adenomus kandianus which was thought to be extinct for 133 years, was rediscovered in this rainforest.
