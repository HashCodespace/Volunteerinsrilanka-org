For those looking to eat healthily and have a delicious treat as well, Sri Lanka has lots of fresh fruits to enjoy. Be it bananas, pineapples, papayas or fresh strawberries grown in the mountains of Nuwara Eliya, there is much to choose from. Sour or sweet mango varieties are also favoured here and are sometimes eaten with chilli and salt in a variation known as “achcharu”. Papaya juice is a popular drink to start to the day, while exotic fruits such as mangosteen, pomegranate, rambutan and durian should definitely be tried at least once!
