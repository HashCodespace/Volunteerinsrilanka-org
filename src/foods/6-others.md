They say “variety is the spice of life” and it is certainly true for Sri Lankan cuisine too! Arouse your taste buds with the dazzling choice of dishes which you can enjoy at a city hotel, holiday resort or even at bustling roadside eateries. You must try Sri Lankan dishes such as hoppers, kottu, string hoppers, pittu or rotti, a type of flatbread that ideally comes with some chilli sambol, veggies and a choice of meats based on your preferences
