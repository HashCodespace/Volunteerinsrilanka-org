The various annual religious and cultural festivals present the ideal time to savour traditional dishes known as ‘sweetmeats’. Due to Sri Lanka’s multicultural nature, each community has their own specialities that you can try. Kavum a kind of hot oil cake can be enjoyed during the period of the Sinhala and Tamil New Year along with other traditional treats like kokis and aluwa. When the Eid season comes along, watalappam is a favoured dish and is a kind of sweet pudding made using jaggery and egg white.
