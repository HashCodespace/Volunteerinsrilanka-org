A quintessential Sri Lankan favourite, rice and curry is very much a part of the national cuisine. In fact, it is not uncommon for people to enjoy this staple diet for all three meals; while you get white and red rice varieties, it is served with meat dishes and a range of different veggies. To complement this culinary journey, a rice and curry dish usually also comes with a choice of accompaniments be it pickle, dried fish or coconut sambol.
