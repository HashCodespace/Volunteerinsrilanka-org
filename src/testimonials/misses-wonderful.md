I volunteered one week in the Turtle Hatchery in Kogalla. It was a great experience. The accommodation is on a hill in Rumassala and you can walk to the Jungle Beach or the Peace Pagoda in a few minutes. The food was very delicious and Mahendra asks what you want to eat everyday to accommodate you. Mahendra was very nice, courteous and does everything, so that one feels welcomed.

The people in the Turtle Hatchery are also very nice and welcoming. I worked in the Hatchery for a few hours a day and could visit various places in my free time afterwards.
