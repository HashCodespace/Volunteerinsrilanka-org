My recent experience being part of VolunteerinSriLanka was a very positive and enjoyable time. I was well looked after by Mahendra and the accommodation was good. I was made feel very welcome and that my contribution was appreciated.

Teaching English to the little monks was both exhilarating and exhausting- in a good way! Their enthusiasm was delightful and their keeness to learn ensured that my time was well spent while teaching.

I highly recommend VolunteerinSriLanka if you are keen to positively contribute to people in Sri Lanka.
