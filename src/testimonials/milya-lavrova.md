I did the program from 15th to 28th march this year and did the Turtles conservation program in Galle since i always loved to care about animals ðŸ’›

I had a separate room, it was clean and in a good condition and I had everything I needed there. And the host Mahendra is just such a lovely and caring person. He is very neat too. We became friends and had some tea together almost every evening and talked about everything, he knows English very well.

Program fee is 160$ and I think it's totally worth it! You get to spend the best vacation and at the same time you know that it has some purpose and meaning too.

And there is also so much stuff to do in Galle, I love this place, you can go surfing there, or go to explore the historical centre or local temple, it's very beautiful, or go to a cafe etc

I already miss Sri Lanka and hope to come back there next year!
