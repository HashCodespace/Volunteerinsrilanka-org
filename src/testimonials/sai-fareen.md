I have visited Sambodhi Home during my trip to Sri Lanka few months back. Mr Mahendra was the main person and in charge of all from guiding, arranging and for the whole volunteering process. He's such a wonderful person, very friendly, helpful and has so much of knowledge. Plus, his English is really good. He's been a friend of mine now and he's a person who makes sure if everything is fine during the stay. Grateful that I met him.

My time in Sambodhi Home was more than just visiting or getting them things they need. As a person I love to connect and help people in ways with people with intellectual and physical challenges. Visiting places like this will change your perspective and you will find deeper meaning to things. I was able to interact with some and some were even way eager to interact with me and this is where you can see how genuinely the people there want human interaction and feel seen/heard. Tho my time was limited last time, I hope to visit this place again in future.

This is located at the prime area, Galle(one of my best spot in down south). Distance away from many stuffs to do and get. A place will make you feel you're in a different country-fort, colonial architecture, the beach in Sri Lanka, you can also get a variety of different cuisines at Galle, diversity of culture.

Definitely not my first time in Sri Lanka but I never had spent time like last year there with friends and meeting new people. What can I say-it's more of home to me than a destination❤️…can't wait to get back!
