title: why should i pay to volunteer
isactive: ['active']

we do not have any financial support or funding of any kind, so volunteers have to fund their projects themselves. the money volunteers pay, allow us to provide them with all the support and services. volunteers will work in places where they are really needed. in addition, the amount of volunteer fees are used as a donation to these organizations to keep the projects running.
