Intermediate and beginner surfers have plenty of space to practise their moves at this south Sri Lankan spot, famous for its fishermen on stilts. The best conditions are in the winter, but continuous breaks are not guaranteed at Koggala itself. The nearby Weligama Beach break is also best suited to those just starting out; sheltered from oncoming winds, the waves are manageable but can reach up to 1.5m (5ft). Midigamaâ€™s waves generate long rides. Ahangama, 20 minutes away, is where the advanced surfers head, especially in the peak season (January to February), when the waves can reach 2.5m (8ft).
