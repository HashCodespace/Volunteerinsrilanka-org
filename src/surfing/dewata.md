Dewata, south of Galle, has turned into a surfing hotspot over the past five or so years. While not the most scenic of local beaches, with small but reliable waves it attracts those looking to perfect their technique on year-round easy surf. Right on the beach, the Shack, with its oil-drum beach bar and rooms, is the hangout of choice, offering lessons and board rentals. The sand reef and regular (if small- to medium-size) waves make it one of the best spots to learn in Sri Lanka, while also providing plenty of fun for the adept.
