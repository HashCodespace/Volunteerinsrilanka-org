Weligama has good waves all year round and is another favourite for beginners and intermediate surfers. The main beach has a row of surfing schools with plenty of boards for rent, but it does sometimes suffer from pollution. The waves are usually easy to learn on and can get a bit bigger for intermediate level surfers. When youâ€™re feeling steady, try Midigama, with three great points. The Lazy Left is better in the afternoons and a favourite with goofy riders. The Right has a shallow reef break, while Rams Right is for more advanced surfers, with some barrels and short and tight breaks.
