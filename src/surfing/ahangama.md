The surfing capital of the Southern Province attracts some serious surfers. With easy access to the waves of Weligama, Unawatuna, Mirissa and Midigama, you’ll find numerous surf camps in this small town, where the shallow reef also attracts keen snorkellers. Surf straight from the long stretch of beach here, and relax under the jungle palms afterwards. The dry season runs from December to March, bringing with it offshore winds and good waves. You’ll still find rideable waves during the wet season, from May to September.
