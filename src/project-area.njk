            History of Galle dates back to 14th century; it was the ancient seaport of Tarshish and King Solomon used it to draw valuables like elephants, peacocks, gemstones. Persians, Arabs, Greeks, Romans, Malays, Indians and Chinese have also used Galle seaport for their business activities during the 14th century. The Galle seaport has played a pivotal role in exportation of spices specially cinnamon from Sri Lanka in early 1400 BC. However, modern history of Galle dates back to 16th century. Portuguese navigators arrived in Galle in 1505 with Lourenco de Almeida and they fortified the city to defend the peninsula on the northern landside. But they were overthrown by the Dutch who arrived in Galle in 1640. Galle saw the pinnacle of its development in the 18th century, before the arrival of the British. Most famous for its centuries old fort, Galle which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site under 'cultural category' declared in 1988, today stands as a city of splendour attracting thousands of local and foreign tourists. Galle represents a perfect blend of European architectural styles and South Asian traditions. There are a number of things to see and do while holidaying in this fortified city of Galle. <br><br>
