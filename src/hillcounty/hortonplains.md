These tranquil grassy woodlands, endlessly swept by crisp, sharp, biting winds, are home to endemic highland birds, leopards, and Smbhar deer. Horton Plains has a land area of 3,160 hectares (12.2 square miles). It has the most extensive cloud forest in Sri Lanka. It is considered the most valuable watershed in the country because it contains the headwaters of three major Sri Lankan rivers, the Mahaweli, Kelani, and Walawe.The plateau drops abruptly by 1650 meters at "Worlds End," the only plausible description that fits the terrifying abyss below, which is frequently shrouded in a mystic mist. On a clear day, it provides a breathtaking view that stretches all the way to the Indian Ocean.
