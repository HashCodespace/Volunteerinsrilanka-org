Haputale is 44 Kms from Nuwaraeliya. The tiny town precariously perched on a Mountain ridge at an elevation of 1579 metres is ensconced in the southern end of the Central Highlands. It has justifiable repute for a climate that is both invigorating and restful. Its great attraction is that it offers an unimpeded view of the plains that extend to the coastal plains of the south and the east and the mountains to its north.It is hemmed in by the mountains of Horton plains, Hakgala and, Namunukula among several other peaks. Turn again and you have another breathtaking view of the foothills that extend to the Southern parts of the island right down to the sea. Under the cloud less sky of a bright day you may devour the sight of a pale blue border of the ocean. The terrain of Haputale tempts you to do many things â€“ walking, hiking and trekking the in the surrounding hills.
