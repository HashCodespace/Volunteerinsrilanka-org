Namunukula at 2036m is a peak that stands in Isolation almost always taking refuge in clouds in the eastern part of the Uva basin that you say in eagle eye view earlier from atop Liptonâ€™s seat at Haputale.
The recommended approach to this seemingly reluctant and elusive mountain terrain is through Spring Valley tea plantation. You have already seen the Namunukula mountain range from the Elle gap that is 19kms away. Before you reach the foot hills of the Mountain range with its nine peaks as its name implies you have a pleasant trek of 6kms through a maze of Rhododendrons and giant trees. Some extremely good primeval forest cover has been preserved on this range. As you climb the giant trees become stunted at about 3-5m forming a dense canopy. The peak it self is covered with shrub jungle allowing a panoramic view of the eastern and southern coasts of the island.
The other two trails to the Second highest peak Kirigalpoththa and the third highest Thotupola kanda begin from Horton plains.
