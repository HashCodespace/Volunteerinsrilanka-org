The base of this famous triangular shaped mountain could be reached from Nuwaraeliya in a leisurely drive in one and half hours. The sinuous trail to Adams peak sacred to four religions Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim and Christian is a journey past the 80m St.Clair falls, and 98m Devon falls and some of the best tea growing plantations. Buddhists believe that the large foot imprint in the shrine atop Adams peak was left by the Buddha. The Hindus worship it as that of Lord Shiva. The Moslems consider it to be that of Adam. The Christians think the foot print is that of St.Thomas the Apostle who prayed on top of this summit. To the physically fir it is an immensely gratifying experience best undertaken during the pilgrim season December to May. The ascent is best undertaken around 2 am to reach the summit before Sun Rise. The endless steps do end when you climb the 7260 feet with tired feet. You stand in solemn silence while watching the muted magnificence of the giant triangular shadow of the Peak falling on the dull dense forests of peaks, valleys and plains that extend to the shores of the island.

The sudden rush of rapture will quietly be replaced with the awesome realization of the mysteries of nature that attempts to replicate celestial eclipses here on earth. The shadow of the Mountain will gradually recede with the rising son in to its bosom. The Mountain Bell will toll signaling that another day has dawned while you were in communion with the heavens.
Nuwareliya gives you the best access to the nature trails to the Cloud Forests of Sri Lanka.
