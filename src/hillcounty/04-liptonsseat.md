Liptons seat is the high light of your wanderings with its magnificent view that was once the delight of Sir Thomas Lipton. It is the highest point of the mountain range, where the famous Tea planter of Ceylon, Sir Thomas Lipton used to admire & enjoy the panoramic view from the Fiefdom he built for himself at Haputale. Do not dally too long. You will miss your Tea and Tiffin if the mist sets in. Elle is a picturesque little town that you must visit that is only.
