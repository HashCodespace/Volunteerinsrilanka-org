The trek to Kirigalpoththa peak 2388m is undoubtedly the most attractive nature trail for both the curious armature and the disciplined naturalist. It takes about 4 hours and is not easy but absolutely possible. The trail leads to wet grass land, cloud forest and shrub jungle at its summit. A bewildering array of wild flowers will thrill you during the best months from February to April, for this tryst with true tropical nature that oozes out from natural springs of water that is the source of the Belihuloya and the Walawe River.
