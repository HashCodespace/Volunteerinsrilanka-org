Weligama or ‘sandy village’ – which is what the name means in the vernacular language – is a picturesque fishing village renowned for its stilt fishermen. A predominate sighting in the sea for passers by, stilt fishermen practice a unique method of fishing where they balance on 50m poles in shallow water and cast their lines out to sea. Although Weligama is a quieter tourist destination with stretches of uninhabited beaches as of recent it has become a noted surf spot with a number of famous surfing points. Its close proximity to Mirissa makes it a good place at which to relax after a couple of hours spent whale watching on the high seas. It is also the location the holiday island Taprobane, the Dondra Lighthouse built during the British Colonial era and numerous cinnamon and rubber plantations. The adventure continues with devil dancers and snake farms as well.
