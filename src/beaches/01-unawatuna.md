Unawatuna is now not just famous for being voted one of the best beaches in the world but for the timeless slogan ‘I love UNA’ which is symbolic of its popularity among tourists and locals alike. A sleepy seaside fishing village about 10 minutes south of the famous Dutch Colonial fort of Galle, Unawatuna has become the ultimate beach and party destination in Sri Lanka. Packed into the stretch of beach which is known as the Unawatuna Bay, are great restaurants, affordable and snazzy accommodation along with some equally fantastic weather. Unawatuna has become a home away from home where ayurvedic massages, lazy swims, beautiful coral reefs and a variety of fish and turtles all cohabit with each other in peace and harmony. For those in need of an escape from the chaos of work or some much needed rest and recreation Una is definitely the place to be.
