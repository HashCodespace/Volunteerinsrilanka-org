Sri Lanka is a haven for nature lovers, with a rich variety of wildlife to observe and admire. Going on a safari is one of the best ways to get up close and personal with the wild animals that call Sri Lanka home.

There are several national parks and reserves in Sri Lanka that offer safari experiences, each with their unique ecosystems and wildlife. Some of the popular parks include Yala National Park, Udawalawe National Park, and Wilpattu National Park.

Visitors can embark on jeep safaris, elephant safaris, bird watching tours, and even camping trips in the heart of the wilderness. These safaris provide a chance to see majestic elephants, leopards, sloth bears, and a myriad of bird species, among other animals.

Guides and rangers are available at each park to ensure the safety of the visitors and the wildlife. The best time to go on a safari is during the dry season, which is typically from June to September. A safari adventure in Sri Lanka is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that is not to be missed.
