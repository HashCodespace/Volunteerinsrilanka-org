The country is a year-round destination because of the seasonal patterns that mean when one coast is choppy, the other is calm. The rains take turns hitting from different directions, too. There will always be waves somewhere. In the south youâ€™ll find perfection between November and May; on the east coast aim for April to October, when the waves are longer. The most famous areas are Unawatuna and Hikkaduwa in the southwest, Weligama in the south and Arugam Bay in the east.
