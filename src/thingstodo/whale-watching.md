Take an exciting yet comfortable boat trip out to sea and be fortunate to see Blue Whales; the largest creatures on earth, Bryde’s Whales, Sperm Whales, Killer Whales and Fin Whales. You can also meet pods of friendly Dolphins such as the Common dolphins, Bottlenose dolphins, Spinner dolphins, Risso’s dolphins and striped dolphins as they playfully somersault and dance on the ocean waves. There’s also a good chance of seeing flying fish, turtle, manta rays and even sharks.

The best time to Whale watch is between November and April each year. Take back beautiful memories of the gentle giants of the ocean; it’s a once-in-lifetime experience. It is 40 minutes ride from your volunteering place
