Often referred to as the 'pearl in the Indian Ocean', Sri Lanka offers world-class Scuba-Diving and Snorkelling tours. A multitude of tropical fish, magnificently colourful coral reefs and fascinating ship wrecks can be explored at several locations off the south coast of Sri Lanka.

Hikkaduwa, Weligama and Kirinda provide breathtaking snorkeling and scuba diving opportunities. In the west of Sri Lanka, head to 'Bar Reef' (Sri Lanka's largest reef, easily accessible from the Puttalam district town of Kalpitiya, spanning an impressive 3 nautical miles in length and 1 nautical mile in breadth). But for the country's 'pièce de resistance', Pigeon Island , off Nilaveli (just north of TRINCOMALEE) is a paradise of turquoise-coloured waters and abundant fish and coral life make it the ultimate underwater experience.

All underwater activities are conducted by well-trained and experienced UDI and PADI instructors to ensure your absolute safety and enjoyment.

N.B. Due to the monsoon seasons, west coast diving and snorkelling is generally best from November to April whilst the east coast waters are at their calmest April – September.
