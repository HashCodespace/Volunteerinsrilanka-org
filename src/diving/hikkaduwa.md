 With its impressive coral reefs and abundance of tropical fish, HIKKADUWA is recognised as one of the best places for Snorkelling and diving on the Southwest coast (in the southwest season of November to April). With a reputed and long-running diving school located in the town itself, PADI diving instructors are available throughout the season for training and certification as well as leading more experienced divers in some of the country's best ship wreck and reef dives.
