description: 'Located on the southern coast of Sri Lanka, Kirinda is a small coastal town that is often overlooked by tourists. However, this hidden gem has plenty to offer for those who venture off the beaten path.'

 On the southeast coast, approximately 10km south of Tissa, lies the pretty village of kirinda. The village itself boasts a superb beach and an interesting Buddhist shrine on the rocks. However, it is best known as a base from which to experience some excellent diving at the famous 'Great Basses' wreck and the Great and Little Basses reefs (southeast of Kirinda). The famous Arthur C Clarke also put Kirinda on the map when he used it as his base for his diving exploration in order to write his book â€˜The Treasure of the Reef'. A particularly unique feature of the Great Basses is the light-house that was actually constructed on the reef in 1860.
