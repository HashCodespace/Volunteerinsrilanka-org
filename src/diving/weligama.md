 Also known as 'sandy village' Weligama is located approximately 30 km east of Galle. As well as having an attractive sandy bay, this fishing town is also an ideal base for Snorkeling and Diving, with many fascinating sites to explore. For those who'd rather stay above the surface of the water, catarmaran rides are a pleasant way to venture out on the sea. You can also go out further to the deeper waters to see a variety of dolphins and sharks. Possible Period Early November to Mid April.
