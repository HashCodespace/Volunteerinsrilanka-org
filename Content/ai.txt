Welcome to Volunteering Sri Lanka, where you can make a difference in the lives of those in need while experiencing the beauty and culture of this incredible country. Our affordable programs offer individuals, couples, families, groups, and students the opportunity to contribute to local communities and immerse themselves in Sri Lankan culture. As the Ancient Heritage Country, Sri Lanka boasts a rich history and unique geography, with a blend of democracy and ancient traditions. From religion and language to customs, art, and cuisine, you'll find a diverse mix here. The friendly people of Sri Lanka make volunteering an even more rewarding experience.

Volunteering is about giving back and immersing yourself in a new culture, which is why we offer a range of programs to suit different interests. Whether you want to teach English, help in an elders' home, participate in turtle conservation, or work in an orphanage, we have the perfect opportunity for you. All of our programs are currently located in Galle, a beautiful city in the south of Sri Lanka with a population of around 2.4 million people.

Donating money or items to those in need feels good, but there's nothing quite like the feeling of knowing you've made a tangible impact by being there in person. Join us at Volunteering Sri Lanka and make memories that will last a lifetime. Our programs are not only a chance to improve the lives of others, but to discover the beauty and diversity of this amazing country. Start your volunteering journey with us today
